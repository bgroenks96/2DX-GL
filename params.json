Also aims to provide utility methods for geometric math and general functionality.\r\n\r\n**Snapdragon2D**\r\n   A 2D Java game engine built on 2DX-GL.  Snapdragon2D utilizes and extends the 2DX-GL API by re-applying its\r\n   functionality and providing its own infrastructure for game development.  Snapdragon2D aims to squeeze the best\r\n   quality and performance through manipulation of the Java standard libraries.\r\n   \r\n**N.B.** Has absolutely no connection to or affiliation with the Qualcomm Snapdragon(tm) mobile processor family.\r\n\r\nOfficial builds are in the 'release_jars' directory and source folders labeled build##.\r\n\r\nCode in the primary source folders ('snapdragon' and 'x2d') is under development and may or may not be complete/working.\r\n\r\nThe 'builds' folder in the project directory contains the latest development builds.\r\nNOTE: These JARs are typically stable, but may not have all features fully implemented or complete.\r\n\r\nRead the commit notes for detailed update information.\r\n\r\n2DX-GL\r\nProject dev status: Alpha\r\nTo-do (next commit):\r\n-Physics engine cleanup/bug fixes if necessary\r\n\r\nSnapdragon2D\r\nProject dev status: Alpha\r\nTo-do (next commit):\r\n-Lighting engine\r\n-Entity mangement (?)\r\n-Snapdragon2D physics package\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional credits:\r\n    Snapdragon2D Sound API utilizes SoundSystem for Java by Paul Lamb [www.paulscode.com]","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
