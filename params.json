Also aims to provide utility methods for geometric math and general functionality.\r\n\r\n**Snap2D**\r\n\r\nA 2D Java game engine built on 2DX-GL.  Snap2D utilizes and extends the 2DX-GL API by re-applying its functionality and providing its own infrastructure for game development.  Snap2D aims to squeeze the best quality and performance through manipulation of the Java standard libraries.\r\n\r\nNotable features:\r\n\r\n-Fast, efficient, high level rendering engines (separate Java2D and OpenGL frameworks)\r\n\r\n-99% cross-platform with expandable native library system\r\n\r\n-2D World management and conversion framework\r\n\r\n-2D timed animation framework (Java2D based)\r\n\r\n-OpenGL shader support (JOGL)\r\n\r\n-Built in image/texture management\r\n\r\n-SnapScript language for fast, portable game scripting\r\n\r\n-Physics framework (2DX + Snap2D expansion)\r\n\r\n-Built in sound library via Paul Lamb's SoundSystem API\r\n\r\n-Rendered user interface framework (independent of Swing/AWT)\r\n\r\n-Math/geometry libraries\r\n\r\n-Numerous provided general utilities\r\n\r\nPlanned features:\r\n\r\n-2D lighting engine for JOGL renderer\r\n-Particle system\r\n-(?) Animation editor and bone system\r\n\r\nOfficial builds are in the 'release_jars' directory and source folders labeled build##.\r\n\r\nCode in the primary source folders ('snapdragon' and 'x2d') is under development and may or may not be complete/working.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to use 2DX/Snap2D for actual application production, I would appreicate it if you let me know on GitHub or by any other means so that I know to be careful about making changes!\r\n\r\nThe 'builds' folder in the project directory contains the latest development builds.  All JARs in this folder include both the base 2DX-GL and Snap2D libraries.\r\n\r\n_NOTE: These JARs are typically stable, but may not have all features fully implemented or complete._\r\n\r\nRead the commit notes for detailed update information.\r\n\r\n**2DX-GL 1st Edition (v.1.0)**\r\n\r\nProject dev status: API-Stable\r\n\r\nTo-do (next commit):\r\n\r\n-Utility additions\r\n-Physics engine cleanup/bug fixes if necessary\r\n\r\n**Snap2D**\r\n\r\nProject dev status: API-Alpha\r\n\r\nTo-do (in development):\r\n\r\n-OpenGL rendering engine (via JOGL 2.0 libraries)\r\n-Snap2D physics package (in development)\r\n-Rendered UI (both J2D and JOGL versions)\r\n\r\nFollow @The2DXProject on Twitter for real-time updates on development of the project!\r\n\r\n**Additional credits:**\r\n\r\nSnap2D Sound API utilizes SoundSystem for Java by Paul Lamb [www.paulscode.com]\r\n\t\r\nOpenGL renderer utilizes JOGL 2.0 by JogAmp [www.jogamp.org] (special thanks to Julien Gouesse for his work and help with JOGL)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
