/**
 * Main class for the Snapdragon2D Sound API.  Allows you to initialize and shutdown the sound system, as well
 * as configure master-settings about Sound processing.
 * 
 * Note that this class internally manages Paul Lamb's SoundSystem, and ONLY subclasses and other classes within this packages should
 * have access to it.  Only one SoundSystem object should exist per application process, so it is HIGHLY recommended that you do not
 * attempt to use SoundSystem or any corresponding libraries within Snapdragon2D directly, unless you are overriding Sound2D with your
 * own implementation.
 * 
 * Snapdragon2D Sound supports the following audio formats: Ogg Vorbis (.ogg), Waveform (.wav), NeXT/Sun AU (.au), Apple AIFF (.aiff).
