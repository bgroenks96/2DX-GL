/**
 * Main class for the Snapdragon2D Sound API. Allows you to initialize and shutdown the sound
 * system, as well as configure master-settings about Sound processing. You can obtain an instance
 * of Sound2D through the SoundAPI class.
 * 
 * Note that this class internally manages Paul Lamb's SoundSystem, and ONLY subclasses and other
 * classes within this packages should have access to it. Only one SoundSystem object should exist
 * per application process, so it is HIGHLY recommended that you do not attempt to use SoundSystem
 * or any corresponding libraries within Snapdragon2D directly, unless you are overriding Sound2D
 * with your own implementation.
 * 
 * Snapdragon2D Sound supports the following audio formats: Ogg Vorbis (.ogg), Waveform (.wav),
 * NeXT/Sun AU (.au), Apple AIFF (.aiff).
 *
