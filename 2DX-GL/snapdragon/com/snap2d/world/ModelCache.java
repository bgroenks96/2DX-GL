/**
 * Uses a simple caching system to store SoftReferences of CollisionModels. The GarbageCollector is
 * free to discard CollisionModels stored ONLY in this cache if available memory is becoming a
 * concern. This means that you may at some point receive null values when obtaining a stored
 * CollisionModel, so if it is needed at that present time, you will need to recreate it. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * The mapping system uses generic Object values as keys. You may associate any Object you like with
 * a CollisionModel for any purpose. For Entity management, it is recommended that you use the
 * Entity implemetnation's <code>Class<?></code> object, as it will allow you to keep one model per
 * Entity class stored in memory and easily accessible in this cache.
