/**
 * A Drawable is an object that defines a specific image to be drawn with each call to its
 * <code>draw(Graphics2D)</code> method. <br>
 * Drawable is used by the Background object (bg.tdx.Background) to set an image that can be
 * continuously redrawn on screen. This functionality makes Drawable<br>
 * a good standard to use for animation. This is why it is also used by the 2DX animation package to
 * define Graphics related tasks that can be repeatedly called upon. <br>
 * <br>
 * Drawable is often best used with anonymous classes:<br>
 * <code>
 * Background background = new Background(new Drawable() {<br>
 *     public void draw(Graphics2D g2) {<br>
 *         //Graphics2D drawing code here<br>
 *     }<br>
 * }
 * </code>
