The 2DX Project - Open Source Java 2D Graphics Library

2DX-GL (Advanced 2-dimensional Graphics Library)
    Extends the Java2D (AWT/Swing) API by adding more high-level functionality for rendering 2D geometry, UIs,
    effects, animations and physics.  Also aims to provide utility methods for geometric math and general functionality.

Snapdragon2D
   A 2D Java game engine built on 2DX-GL.  Snapdragon2D utilizes and extends the 2DX-GL API by re-applying its
   functionality and providing its own infrastructure for game development.  Snapdragon2D aims to squeeze the best
   quality and performance through manipulation of the Java standard libraries.
   **N.B.** Has absolutely no connection to or affiliation with the Qualcomm Snapdragon(tm) mobile processor family.

Official builds are in the 'release_jars' directory and source folders labeled build##.

Code in the primary source folders ('snapdragon' and 'x2d') is under development and may or may not be complete/working.

If you decide to use 2DX/Snap2D for actual application production, I would appreicate it if you let me know on GitHub or by any other means so that I know to be careful about making changes!

The 'builds' folder in the project directory contains the latest development builds.
NOTE: These JARs are typically stable, but may not have all features fully implemented or complete.
