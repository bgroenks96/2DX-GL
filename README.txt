The 2DX Project - Open Source 2D Graphics Library

Official builds are in the 'release_jars' directory and source folders labeled build##.

Code in the primary source folders ('snapdragon' and 'x2d') is under development and may or may not be complete/working.

The 'builds' folder in the project directory contains the latest development builds.
NOTE: These JARs are typically stable, but may not have all features fully implemented or complete.
